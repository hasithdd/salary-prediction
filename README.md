Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

Overview

This project aims to predict salaries based on job experience using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing information on job experience and corresponding salaries to build a predictive model.
Dataset

The dataset (Salary_Data.csv) consists of two columns:

    YearsExperience: Job experience in years.
    Salary: Corresponding salary for the given experience.

Requirements

To run the code, you need the following libraries installed:

    pandas
    numpy
    plotly
    scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

    pip install pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn

Usage

    Clone or download the repository.
    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Install the required libraries mentioned above.
    Run the salary_prediction.py script using Python.
    Follow the prompts to input the years of experience and get the predicted salary.

File Structure

    salary_prediction.py: Python script containing the code for salary prediction.
    Salary_Data.csv: Dataset containing job experience and corresponding salaries.
